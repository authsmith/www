::section
AuthSmith is a centralized, open-source authentication platform. It uses standard protocols and methods to implement multiple authentication paradigms across all languages and frameworks.

<br/>

It is also a developer-first platform for building custom authentication services using built-in APIs and SDKs, making it easier to scale and configure fine-grained access levels to meet all application security requirements.

<br/>

Apart from the core services, it also provides authentication plugins for various applications and frameworks. These plugins make it easier to integrate OAuth, custom authentication, MFA, Passkey, and many other authentication methods into your projects.
